/**
 * The <code>Tokenizer</code> is used to extract valid tokens from
 * the stream of bytes given to it for scanning. Identifying the
 * tokens from the stream of input is done using delimiters to
 * specify the start and end of a valid token. For example take
 * the well known JSP syntax. A parsable segment typically opens
 * using the following token <code>&lt;%</code> and closes with
 * the <code>%&gt;</code>, as shown in the JSP text shown below.
 * <pre>
 *
 * &lt;%= new java.util.Date() %&gt;
 *
 * </pre>
 * This tokenizer can be used to extract HTML expressions and
 * other such formats by specifying the starting and ending of
 * the expression. For example the following HTML could be used
 * to specify the opening and closure of an valid token.
 * <pre>
 *
 * &lt;script language='groovy'&gt;
 *    java.util.Date();
 * &lt;/script&gt;
 *
 * </pre>
 * The above token will be identified using a case insensitive
 * match, and whitespace characters can be ignored, such that
 * the HTML does not have to be formatted correctly in order
 * for this tokenizer to extract the HTML as a valid token.
