 * The <code>Page</code> object is used to parse the page token. The
 * page token is the most complex token parsed from the JSP source.
 * It defines the properties of the genrated page, such as the imports
 * that should be used, and the content type of the page. For example.
 * <pre>
 *
 *    &lt;%@ page import="a,b,c,d" 
 *                contentType="text/html; charset=UTF-8" 
 *                extend="blah" 
 *                language="java" %&gt;
 *
 * </pre>
 * The above token is an example page directive. It includes information
 * regarding the imports that are to be used, as well as the content
 * type of the generated page. It also includes the runtime language.
