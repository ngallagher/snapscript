/**
 * A <code>Definition</code> object is used to gather information 
 * regarding a JSP source file. During translation, a JSP source file
 * undergoes a lexical analysis phase, where the file is broken up
 * into digestable tokens. These tokens are parsed and used in the
 * building phase of translation. As the building phase progresses
 * data is placed into a definition so that it can be used in a
 * generation step. For example, take the following token.
 * <pre>
 * 
 *    &lt;%@ page import=&quot;java.util.List,
 *                        java.util.Iterator,
 *                         java.util.Map&quot; %&gt;
 *
 * </pre>
 * When parsed, this generates a list of import packages, which will
 * be needed in the generation phase to compose the Java or Groovy
 * source file. So, during building, each import can be added to the
 * JSP <code>Definition</code>, where it can be later retrieved and
 * used by the source code generator. For more information on how
 * this object is used see the <code>Builder</code> object.
