/**
 * The <code>Tracker</code> is used to keep track of files within
 * the project source directory. This allows the compiler to perform
 * background compilation, such that a translated and compiled JSP
 * file can be monitored for changes. Should a change occur the 
 * JSP can be translated and compiled with any modifications. This
 * also performs its checks in a way that allows multiple contexts
 * to be used. This allows JSP files to be overridden by simply
 * changing the context it lives within.
 * <p>
 * As well as allowing the compiler to determine when modifications
 * are made to the source JSP, this will allow the generator to
 * determine the JSP source files included within the root file.
 * This allows, informative comments to be embedded.
